# ATX Open PC Frame Project

# Purpose of This Repo

- I haven't printed anything in several months, I guess I was bored.
- I haven't printed a design so big, and so important (it will house, or hold I should say, my PC).
- I need to upgrade my mini case (too hard to do upgrades), but don't want to spend the money right now. This design will tide me over.
- Other users might find models that have already been pre-configured print settings useful.
- Most importantly, I just love this design!
